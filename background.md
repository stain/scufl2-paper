# Background

## Overview of Taverna workflow structure

* Workflow, processor, activity, ports, datalinks
* [Taverna Reloaded and architecture](http://www.taverna.org.uk/pages/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/T2Architecture.pdf)
* Brief on Engine architecture (iterations,  dispatch)
* Some picture

## Earlier formats: scufl and t2flow

* scufl: Simple XML format - describing only the dataflow
  * Many implications - e.g. a datalink between two ports mean those ports exist
  * Almost no metadata
  * No structured information about services - "Insert XML here" logic
  * Easily generated by third-parties
  * Some-what executeable by other third-parties
    * .. but they usually get the workflow semantics wrong 
  * Easy to edit by hand
* t2flow
  * Built around T2 engine and its implementation
    * e.g. support for multiple activities, dispatch stack, richer iteration strategies
  * XMLBeans serialization of engine state
  * Execution engine not separated from design workbench
  * Stronger annotation support
  * Parsing takes a long time as it recreates the engine state - even if you just need to edit
  * Hard to consume - very noisy
  * Exposes the complete structure of the engine
  * Very hard to generate - need to have template-based copy-and-paste
  * Impossible to edit by hand
  
## Motivations for SCUFL2

* Modular
 * Workbench vs Command line vs Server vs Grid
* Independence from engine implementation
* Programmatic access outside Taverna
* Semantic annotations - 
* Semantic inspection
* Flexibility - should not need to say everything
* Translations - load/save other workflow formats
* Embedding - add resources without having to serialize them within a massive XML

Not a requirement:
 * Editing by hand (Still need to know a lot about the services)
 * Too much implicitly - only implicit-where-appropriate (e.g. useful defaults)
